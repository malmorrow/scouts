This is a web application for a Cub Akela who is frustrated by paperwork. He wants to run Cubs, he doesn't really want to do more than the minimum, and easiest, amount of admin. The application ought to support the following:

1. Parents can sign-up their kids, generate the application form, sign it, scan it, and dispatch it to the Akela.
2. The Akela admits the Cub.  This distributes the starting pack of information to the parents and the new Cub, and forwards the application form and other documents to the Scout Province.
3. The Akela can configure badges, and a checklist of activities for each badge.
4. Cubs can choose badges they want to work on.
5. The Akela can track activities done by Cubs.
6. Cubs can track which activities they must complete for the badges they are working on.
7. The Akela will get a badge notice, when the Cub completes all the activities required for a badge.
8. The Akela can award the badge.  This distributes information to the parents, the Cub, and the Scout Province.
9. Parents and Cubs can see a Cub's awarded badges on a PDF poster.
10. Parents and Cubs can see a Cub's awarded badges on a shirt layout, and (within limits) re-arrange the badges on the shirt layout.
11. The Akela can create an event, such as a camp.
12. Parents can view forthcoming activities and events in the application, or in their own calendar applications, if they are subscribed to Cub events.
13. The Akela can set up a consent form for an activity or event.
14. The Akela can publish a consent form. This distributes the consent form to the parents of all Cubs in the pack.
15. Parents can acknowledge the consent form.  This returns the consent form to the Akela.  Currently, the Scout Province doesn't need a copy of the consent form.
16. Parents can state which of their Cubs are going to which events.
17. The Akela can view which Cubs are going to which events, which parents have completed the consent form, and any discrepancies.
